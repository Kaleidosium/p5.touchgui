## Why p5.touchgui?

![Image of three different presets for p5.touchgui: Blue, Rose, and Seafoam](design/p5touchgui.png)

[*p5.js*](https://p5js.org) is a wonderfully accessible way for students and creative minds to both learn computer programming and create interactive art and experiences. 

*p5.touchgui* is intended to extend *p5.js* and make it easy to add buttons, sliders, and other GUI (graphical user interface) objects to your *p5.js* sketches, enabling you to focus on quickly iterating ideas with easily created GUI objects that work with both mouse and multi-touch input.

If you'd like to read more about the process, please check out my [Google Summer of Code report](docs/L05_gsoc_2019.md).

# Getting Started

## Quick Start
[[Back to top]](#p5touchgui)

There are two ways to quickly get started with p5.touchgui.

### Option 1 - p5.js editor

Open this [p5.js web editor sketch with p5.touchgui.js added](https://editor.p5js.org/L05/sketches/YjR7CxKg-).

### Option 2 - index.html

In an **index.html** file, copy and paste the following and open up that file in your web browser.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

  </head>

  <body>
    <script>
      // Your code will go here
      let gui;
      let b;

      function setup(){
        createCanvas(400, 400);
                       
        gui = createGui();
        b = createButton("Button", 50, 50);
      }

      function draw(){
        background(200);
        drawGui();

        if(b.isPressed) {
          print(b.label + " is pressed.");
        }
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
That's all!

## My First Button
[[Back to top]](#p5touchgui)

*(Follow along [here](https://editor.p5js.org/L05/sketches/YjR7CxKg-).)*

1. Declare a variable named `gui` and use `createGui()` to create a new GUI context. This is where each of your GUI objects is tracked and updated.
```javascript
let gui;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  
  gui = createGui();
}
```

2. Declare a variable called `b` and use `createButton()` to add a new button.
```javascript
let gui;
let b;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  
  gui = createGui();
  b = createButton("myButton", 50, 50);
}
```
3. Make sure to call `drawGui()` in your `draw()` loop. You can call it anywhere, but make sure to do so after you draw your `background()`. 

	If you run your sketch now, you should see your button drawn on the screen at an *x* position of 50 and a *y* position of 50.
```javascript
function draw() {
  background(220);
  drawGui();
}
```
4. `if()` your button is `.isPressed`, you can choose to perform actions. In this example, we will `print()` a message using the button's `.label`.
```javascript
function draw() {
  background(220);
  drawGui();

  if(b.isPressed) {
    print(b.label + " is pressed.");
  }
}
```
5. All together your [p5.js](https://p5js.org) sketch should look like:
```javascript
let gui;
let b;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  
  gui = createGui();
  b = createButton("Button", 50, 50);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
  drawGui();

  if(b.isPressed) {
    print(b.label + " is pressed.");
  }
}
```
Congratulations! You've created your first sketch using *p5.touchgui*. If you want to see what this looks like, [click here](https://editor.p5js.org/L05/sketches/YjR7CxKg-).

## Using the OSC Examples
[[Back to top]](#p5touchgui)

In order to run the OSC examples you'll need to do the following:

1. [Download and install node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

2. Open a terminal or command prompt (on Windows you might need to open the command prompt as admin).

3. In the terminal, navigate to your *p5.touchgui* directory using `cd`.

4. In the terminal type to install dependencies needed by *p5.touchgui* to run the OSC examples:
`npm install`

5. Type the following in the terminal to install node.js `http-server`:
`npm install -g http-server`

6. Then start a local server by typing in the terminal:
`http-server -c-1`

7. Open a new terminal or command prompt (again, on Windows you might need to open the command prompt as admin).

8. Use `cd` to navigate to the `examples/osc` folder within your *p5.touchgui* directory.

9. Once there, type in the terminal:
`node bridge.js`

10. Then point your browser to `http://localhost:8080/index.html` and use the menu to select the OSC examples.
